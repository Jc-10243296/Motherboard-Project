            <a class="cpuInfo">The CPU is also known as the Central Processing Unit. This provides the computer with processing power in order to do the tasks that it needs to do. It can be overclocked (or not) depending on what you need. If you want more speed, however, then overclocking the cpu can provide slightly better performance. Some fun facts is that present CPUS need about 582 million transistors in order to function</a>
